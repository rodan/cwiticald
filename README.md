### Build requirements

dependencies include a gcc-based linux toolchain, together with the pthread and libevent-2.* libraries

### Usage

see the manual

### Testing

the code itself is static-scanned by [llvm's scan-build](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/), [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.net/) and [coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/rodan-cwiticald?tab=overview). Dynamic memory allocation in the PC applications is checked with [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/).
